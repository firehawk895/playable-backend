The request object in firebase will have the "type" key with the following:
type: {
    connect: "connectRequest", //connect
    match: "OneOnOneMatchRequest", //fix a match
    invite: "inviteToMatchRequest", //host invites someone for a match
    join: "joinMatchRequest" //player requests to play in a match
}

the status of the request will be:
status: {
    accepted: "accepted",
    rejected: "rejected",
    pending: "pending"
}

Here are the actions that need to be performed:
1. send connect request: call POST /user/connect
   accept/reject a connect request: just change the status to "accepted"/"rejected" in firebase

2. send fix a match request - call POST /user/fixamatch
	(a) open host a match screen with slots = 2, invitedUserIds with the other person's id. disable adding any more players or changing slots. POST user/fixamatch expects the same format as
	accept/reject a fix a match request: just change the status to "accepted"/"rejected" in firebase

3. host invites someone for a match:
	1. if you are hosting a match, just send the comma seperated invited users in the key invitedUserIds (already in postman)
	2. If you are editing an already hosted match, call the POST matches/invite API and send a comma seperated list of userIds in the key invitedUserids

	accept a invite: when accepting an invite, switch firebase key to accepted and call the /join API with the details in the request object
	reject a invite: set firebase key to rejected
